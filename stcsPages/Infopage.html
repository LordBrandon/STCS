Subway delays have become a frustrating fact of life in New York City. Every day a new set of alerts about painful disruptions come across the media. The truth behind delays is the aging equipment in the 112 year old system,That causes signal problems,this is an enormous problem.The major cause of subway delays is the train system wasn't made for overcrowding. Large crowds slow down trains by MTA has an target time to board everyone in  30 seconds, but it doesnâ€™t take 30 seconds it take about 45 seconds to 1 minute in that time people start to come and that creates more crowding. There's a company called STCS, that company aims to decrease the delays in the train system. They will make a AI that will use satellite signals to show where the traffic is and will try to solve the issue by giving the riders better routes to reach there destination on time.
